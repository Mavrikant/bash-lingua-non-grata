# Security

- Don't put secret data in environment variables.
- Don't pass secret data in an external command's arguments (pass them in via a pipe or redirection instead).

```
docker login --username foo --password my_password
# better
cat ~/my_password.txt | docker login --username foo --password-stdin
```
- Validate all external input and never `eval` input

[filename](../../examples/security/dont_use_eval.sh ':include :type=code bash')

```
bash ./examples/security/dont_use_eval.sh func2
```

- Set your `$PATH` carefully. Don't just trust whatever path you inherit from the caller if your script is running as `root`
