# When to use

- If
  - you call some commands, binaries
  - no user interaction or limited amount
  - you utilize output from one command to another (piping)
  - you execute simple tasks (up to 100 lines of code)

- It is better to use Python instead of BASH in some certain cases. Please check references for more details.
